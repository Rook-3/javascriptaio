document your code with comments to help yourself and others know what a particular line does

README FIle
instructions may apply to your js program rather than a particular file or function. Written in a txt or .md(markdown)

In a mark down you give a header like this:
# Gamelet  (LV1 heading)

## Usage (LV2 heading)

1. Include gamelet.js in an html document containg an element with an id of 'ball'

``` 
<div id="ball">@</div>
<script src="gamelet.js">  The 6 batticks is how you display code
```

Version Control
To code responsibly, what if you collab with a person or team and find out you are working on the samething, or to keep
track of certain points etc. Use GIT

Git creates Snapshots of a project containing only the files that have changed in each version (Install Git)
inside vs code terminal type git --version

inside the terminal

git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
git config --global user.name "yourname"

Source Control on Vs code

Git has 3 states: modified (changes but havent committed to database) Stage (means you've marked a modified file to be a part your next commit), and Committed (file is stored in your local Git database)

hit the "+" to stage
enter a commit message then execute
